There are 2 example pre-made locations in the config. You can create new ones by copying, for example, the lines from the config between line 38 and line 75 and pasting the copied content under line 75.

You can also easily create DJ locations through our ingame creator. You can enable it in the config with Config.InGameDjCreator. By default, the command is /djcreator, but you need to set the permissions for opening it in configure perms in server/other.lua in the CheckDjCreatorPermission function.
